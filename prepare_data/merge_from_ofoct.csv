1022,Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access,Variant,Incomplete,"The web application produces links to untrusted external sites outside of its sphere of control, but it does not properly prevent the external site from modifying security-critical properties of the window.opener object, such as the location property."
1023,Incomplete Comparison with Missing Factors,Class,Incomplete,"The software performs a comparison between entities that must consider multiple factors or characteristics of each entity, but the comparison does not include one or more of these factors."
1038,Insecure Automated Optimizations,Class,Draft,"The product uses a mechanism that automatically optimizes code, e.g. to improve a characteristic such as performance, but the optimizations can have an unintended side effect that might violate an intended security assumption."
1039,Automated Recognition Mechanism with Inadequate Detection or Handling of Adversarial Input Perturbations,Class,Incomplete,"The product uses an automated mechanism such as machine learning to recognize complex data inputs (e.g. image or audio) as a particular concept or category, but it does not properly detect or handle inputs that have been modified or constructed in a way that causes the mechanism to detect a different, incorrect concept."
1042,Static Member Data Element outside of a Singleton Class Element,Variant,Incomplete,"The code contains a member element that is declared as static (but not final), in which its parent class element is not a singleton class - that is, a class element that can be used only once in the 'to' association of a Create action."
1059,Incomplete Documentation,Class,Incomplete,"The documentation, whether on paper or in electronic form, does not contain descriptions of all the relevant elements of the product, such as its usage, structure, interfaces, design, implementation, configuration, operation, etc."
